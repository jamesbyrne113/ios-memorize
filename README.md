# Card Matching Memory Game

A card matching memory game for iOS devices using SwiftUI with different themes. This game is from the lectures (slides and demos) and the first 2 assignments in the online Stanford [CS193p - Developing Apps for iOS](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu)

The game consists of an even number of cards on the screen where each card has a symbol on in and each symbol is on two cards. The cards are turned over to reveal the symbols (max of two displayed) and the cards with the same symbols are matched.
